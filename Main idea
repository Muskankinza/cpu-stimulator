Main Idea:
A software programme called a CPU scheduling simulator enables users to model and examine various CPU scheduling algorithms. 
Users can assess and compare the performance of various scheduling policies in a virtual environment where processes are scheduled and run on a simulated CPU.

A CPU scheduling simulator is used to better understand how scheduling algorithms behave and
what impact they have on different metrics, including CPU utilisation, waiting time, turnaround time, and reaction time. 
Users can learn more about the efficiency and effectiveness 
of different scheduling policies in various settings by simulating various scenarios and workload patterns.


An interface is typically provided by a CPU scheduling simulator so that users can enter information such process arrival times, burst times, and priority levels.
